## Where can I ask for help?

You can ask for help to [developpers team](#Contributors) or on the issue/PR.

(When interacting with us, please be human being)

## Coding style

We use SonarLint as coding style.

You can use the SonarLint plugin for your IDE.

## Commit format

In the project, we use [Angular Commit Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

## Labels

Each labels must be the type of the Issue.
/!\ It's not the work functional type but the type of the issue. /!\

## Branch

### Namming

Branch should have an automatic namming due to branch creation via issues. But if you create a branch from nothing you must use [Angular Commit Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).

## Pull Requests (PR)

### Namming

If you create a PR, you must use [Angular Commit Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).

(In most of the case, you can reuse issue name)

### Process

#### Code review

For each PR we'll have a code review, the PR must be approved by 2 developper of the [developpers team](#Contributors).

#### PR Stability

Look at the [**Testing Policies**](#testing-policies)

#### Miscellaneous

Don't add to R-Type github project except if the PR doesn't have issue (it shouldn't be the case but why not).

Don't add to any Milestone of the project. If you doubt, ask to [developpers team](#Contributors).

## Milestone

Milestone are used to organize the project. Each milestone must have a description and a due date. A milestone should be linked to an issue or a PR. A milestone should be linked to a set of functionnalities that makes the project works or a set of functionnalities that makes the project coherent.

### Namming

If you create a milestone, you must use [Angular Commit Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).

## Testing Policies

### Unit tests

Please do unit tests with [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) if you can. We don't have a coverage goal for the moment.

### Functional tests

We don't force you to do functional tests but if you can do it, it's better. We use [Ftest](https://github.com/Atomot/ftest) for functional tests.

### CI / CD

We have a really basic CI at the moment.
